Built-for / Next steps (MERN)
This is a static front-end template. To convert this into a full MERN stack project, you can:

1. Create a React app (frontend) and move the HTML markup into React components.
2. Create a Node.js + Express backend to handle contact forms, testimonials, or project management.
3. Use MongoDB Atlas (or local MongoDB) to store testimonials, projects, or contact requests.
4. Deploy backend (Heroku, Render, Railway) and frontend (Vercel, Netlify) and connect the two.

Quick local preview
- Open `index.html` in any browser.

Adding a hero photo

1. To use your personal photo as the hero background place an image named `hero-bg.jpg` inside the `PORTFOLIO` folder next to `index.html` and `style.css`.
2. The CSS applies a dark overlay to keep text readable. For best results use a landscape photo at least 1600px wide.
3. If you want me to add the image for you, upload the photo and I'll place it in the folder and fine-tune positioning.

License & notes
- This is a simple portfolio starter. Add your images, testimonials and project screenshots to make it richer.
